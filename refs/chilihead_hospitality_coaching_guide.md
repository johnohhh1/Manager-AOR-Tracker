#### Scenario 1: Host on Phone When Guests Enter
**WHAT YOU SEE**: Host finishing text message, guests standing at host stand for 45 seconds

**COACHING MOMENT**:
- "Hey [Name], I noticed guests waiting at the stand. What happened?"
- **TEACH**: "Our 30-second greeting creates the first impression. If you need to check your phone, step to the back for 10 seconds so you can give guests your full attention when they arrive."
- **PRACTICE**: "Let's practice: I'm a guest walking in, show me your best welcome!"

#### Scenario 2: Weak Greeting Energy
**WHAT YOU SEE**: Monotone "welcome to chili's" without smile or eye contact

**COACHING MOMENT**:
- "I heard you greet that table, but let me show you the difference..." [demonstrate enthusiastic greeting]
- **TEACH**: "Guests decide in 7 seconds if they want to be here. Your energy sets the tone for their whole experience."
- **PRACTICE**: Have them greet you 3 times with increasing energy

**WHAT YOU SEE**: Guests leaving, pushing door open themselves while host watches

**COACHING MOMENT**:

#### Scenario 2: No Recommendation Given
**WHAT YOU SEE**: Server greets, asks "What can I get started for you?" without suggesting anything

**COACHING MOMENT**:
- "Great greeting speed! I want you to add one thing - a specific recommendation. Why do you think that matters?"

#### Scenario 2: Slow Drink Running
**WHAT YOU SEE**: Drinks sitting in well for 3+ minutes while runner is clearing table

#### Scenario 2: Floor Not Swept After Bussing
**WHAT YOU SEE**: Table clean but fries and crumbs on floor

**COACHING MOMENT**:
